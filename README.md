# Introduction

This project is exactly what it sounds like — a chat app. Think of it as a minimalist version of Discord or WhatsApp. You can easily create a account and share your unique username with anyone you wish to connect with, fostering a more personal and controlled communication experience.

No unnecessary features, no clutter—just clean, private conversations. It’s all about keeping it simple, secure, and focused. Perfect for when you just want to connect without the noise.
